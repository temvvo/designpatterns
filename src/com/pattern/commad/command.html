<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr"><h1>Design Patterns - Command Pattern 
</h1>
<p>Command pattern is a data driven design pattern and falls under
behavioral pattern category. A request is wrapped under an object as
command and passed to invoker object. Invoker object looks for the
appropriate object which can handle this command and passes the
command to the corresponding object which executes the command.</p>
<h2 class="western">Implementation</h2>
<p>We have created an interface <i>Order</i> which is acting as a
command. We have created a <i>Stock</i> class which acts as a
request. We have concrete command classes <i>BuyStock</i> and
<i>SellStock</i> implementing <i>Order</i> interface which will do
actual command processing. A class <i>Broker</i> is created which
acts as an invoker object. It can take and place orders.</p>
<p><i>Broker</i> object uses command pattern to identify which object
will execute which command based on the type of command.
<i>CommandPatternDemo</i>, our demo class, will use <i>Broker</i>
class to demonstrate command pattern.</p>
