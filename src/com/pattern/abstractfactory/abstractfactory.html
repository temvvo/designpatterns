<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr"><h1>Design Pattern - Abstract Factory Pattern</h1>
<p>Abstract Factory patterns work around
a super-factory which creates other factories. This factory is also
called as factory of factories. This type of design pattern comes
under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best
ways to create an object.</p>
<p>In Abstract Factory pattern an interface is responsible for
creating a factory of related objects without explicitly specifying
their classes. Each generated factory can give the objects as per the
Factory pattern.</p>
<h2 class="western">Implementation</h2>
<p>We are going to create a Shape interface and a concrete class
implementing it. We create an abstract factory class AbstractFactory
as next step. Factory class ShapeFactory is defined, which extends
AbstractFactory. A factory creator/generator class FactoryProducer is
created.</p>
<p>AbstractFactoryPatternDemo, our demo class uses FactoryProducer to
get a AbstractFactory object. It will pass information (CIRCLE /
RECTANGLE / SQUARE for Shape) to AbstractFactory to get the type of
object it needs.</p>
